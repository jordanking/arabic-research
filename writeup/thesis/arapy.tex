\section{Arapy}
\label{sec:arapy}

All preprocessing, normalization, and training processes utilize the python package we developed, which we will release as an open source utility. It utilizes various software resources, including gensim, Madamira, the Google Translate API, the Big Huge Thesaurus API, \cite{google:online,bhl:online}. 
\\
We developed a package of Arabic text processing tools while working on this research. Arapy includes many useful tools for simple natural language processing tasks that can be difficult when working with Arabic. The first is a module providing a MADAMIRA wrapper that provides access to the part-of-speech tagging, base phrase chunking, tokenization, and lemmatization features of MADAMIRA. There is also a wrapper providing various tools for training and evaluating Arabic word embeddings, largely as a wrapper for gensim methods. Arapy also includes a modules for Arabic text normalization, translation with Google Translate, simulation of an Arabic thesaurus using translation and the Big Huge Thesaurus API, and cleaning the Arabic Wikipedia dump.
\\
The dependancies for this package are Java for \textcolor{red}{MADAMIRA}, the MADAMIRA jar and a license for MADAMIRA, gensim for word2vec model operations, a Google API key for translation, a Big Huge Thesaurus API key for thesaurus simulation,
