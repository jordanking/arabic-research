\section{Conclusion and Future Directions}

The contributions of this work are as follows: 1) We perform a comparative empirical evaluation of Arabic and English word vectors using a semantic similarity task. We show that standard parameters for English word embeddings lead to poor Arabic word embeddings. 2) We develop and open-source a simple software package that provides easy access to important Arabic natural language processing tools. 3) We present a semantic similarity task using a team of native Arabic speakers. This task is larger than other published tasks and uses multiple native speakers to manually provide high quality human labels. 4) We present an empirical analysis identifying the parameters that are most effective for our tasks, identifying a set of best practices for training Arabic word embeddings.
